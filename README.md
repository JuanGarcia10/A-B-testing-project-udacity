# SUMMARY

this project is part of the data analyst nanodegree from Udacity. We will be analyzing information about an on-line retailer and a new web page design. We aim to give the on-line retailer a suggestion of whether she/he should implement the new design

# IMPORTANT

this project will not be pursued after finishing the nanodegree. However if you are interested in basic command lines to analyze data and derive suggestions based on statistics, this could be interesting to you.

# DATA SET

The dataset was provided by Udacity and will not be published in this repository
